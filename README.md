![thumbnail icon](media/thumbnail.png)

Adds a hotkey to move the camera view to the current level's exits.  Helpful when the player is moving loot back to the shuttle from multiple floors.

Press left bracket for move to the down elevator.  Press right bracked to move to the up elevator or shuttle.

The camera will only move if the target has already been explored.

The hotkeys can be configured.
